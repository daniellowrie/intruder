# intruder
This is a simple learning/practical project that is an example of how having programming skills is to the benefit of the hacker.

It was born from Burp Suite Community Edition throttling performance when using Intruder and wondering how difficult it would be
to create a custom tool that was faster. 

This is just a basic example and only works in one specific instance (OWASP Juice Shop login), but with a bit of work, could be 
expanded to act more like its namesake
